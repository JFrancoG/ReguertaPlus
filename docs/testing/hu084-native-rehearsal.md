# HU-084 native local rehearsal

This Debug-only route uses memory-only Auth emulator credentials and the provisional
coverage API. It never enters the normal Firebase login graph. The provisional
policy, entropy provider and production activation remain separate decisions.

From `functions`, with dependencies and a compatible Java runtime installed:

```sh
npm run build
firebase emulators:exec --config ../firebase.coverage-emulator.json \
  --project demo-reguerta-hu084-coverage --only firestore,auth \
  'GCLOUD_PROJECT=demo-reguerta-hu084-coverage METADATA_SERVER_DETECTION=none node test/shift-coverage-native-rehearsal.cjs'
```

The fixture resets only `develop/plus-collections` and Auth accounts inside the
fixed demo emulators (Firestore 8798, Auth 9098). The API binds to 127.0.0.1:8799.
Virtual time is 2027-09-02 10:00 UTC. Stop the command to close the local services.
Restarting rebuilds the fixture, so keep this rehearsal separate from other tests.

Launch the iOS Debug app with `-coverageRehearsal`, or launch Android Debug on an
emulator with:

```sh
adb -s EMULATOR_ID shell am start \
  -n com.reguerta.user.debug/com.reguerta.user.CoverageRehearsalActivity
```

Android uses a separate `:coverage_rehearsal` process, with no default-process
FirebaseInitProvider or MainActivity composition. Cleartext is allowed only for
127.0.0.1 and Android's emulator host alias 10.0.2.2. iOS uses the existing test
composition with push disabled. Neither route is registered in Release.

All fixture accounts use `local-fixture-password`:

- `d@example.test`: open **Market**, accept the offer and inspect read-back.
- `admin@example.test`: open **Delivery**, confirm that coverage was completed.
- `e@example.test`: inspect the resulting pending delivery credit.
- `a@example.test`: original assigned member, available for absence forms.

The route also renders volunteer/reserve/draw/admin states when supplied by the
local API. The fixture does not configure an entropy provider. iOS edits an offer
expiry as a date/time; Android edits minutes from the form's reference time. Both
validate against the server policy and revalidate the current deadline before
sending. Shift dates are shown without implying a service time.

Unsigned credentials are accepted only for the fixed Auth emulator project and
captured UID; the server verifies identity and canonical membership again. Tokens
are never persisted or logged, and expiry/revocation requires signing in again.
Unknown command outcomes retain the exact operation for explicit retry; new
mutations remain disabled. The backend owns eligibility, conflicts and credits.

The read model includes future assigned slots (maximum 500), minimal member names
and admin-only eligibility hints (maximum 500 members), including an inactive owner
still assigned to a future slot. It does not expose private selection snapshots,
exclusions, Auth UIDs, emails or another member's credit.

The iOS acceptance test is explicitly opt-in, while the services above are ready:

```sh
TEST_RUNNER_COVERAGE_REHEARSAL=1 xcodebuild test \
  -project Reguerta.xcodeproj -scheme Reguerta -testPlan release-gate-v1 \
  -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 17,OS=26.5' \
  -only-testing:ReguertaUITests/CoverageRehearsalUITests \
  -parallel-testing-enabled NO
```

Run from `ios/Reguerta`. Recreate the fixture before repeating the acceptance test.
The test skips in ordinary gates. No notification/Sheets effect, live deployment,
VoiceOver approval or full device/layout matrix is implied by this rehearsal.

After completing delivery as admin, run the AX5 credit read test separately with
`TEST_RUNNER_COVERAGE_CREDIT_REHEARSAL=1` and
`-only-testing:ReguertaUITests/CoverageRehearsalUITests/testLocalEarnedCreditAtAccessibilitySize`.
It requires the completed-delivery state and skips unless explicitly selected by
that environment flag. It records a persistent screenshot in the result bundle.
